# Youtuber-App-MAD1

Assignment for Mobile App Development 1

## App Overview

My Android Mobile Application is called the YouTuber App. This app offers a way for users to store information about their favourite YouTubers such as their name, channel name, date of birth, an image of them, their work location via Google Maps and a rating. 

I developed this app using Kotlin and Android Studio by combining practical lab notes from class, self-learning, and independent research.

## App Functionality

**Functionality added in Assignment 1:**

- YouTubers can be added with information including their name, channel name, date of birth, image and rating
- YouTubers are listed via a RecyclerView on the main page activity
- YouTubers information can be edited/updated
- YouTubers can be deleted
- Mark YouTubers as favourite 

**Functionality added in Assignment 2:**

-	Login and Sign-Up activity screens were added with Firebase Authentication (user account information is stored in Firebase)
-	Map feature added (when adding a YouTuber a user can now add their work location via Google Maps)
-	ALL YouTuber locations are displayed and can be viewed on map also
-	All YouTubers can be deleted at the same time (In order to prevent accidental deletion, a warning message appears beforehand to ask the user if they are sure that they want to delete the YouTuber(s))
-	Animated Splash Screen added on app launch
-	YouTubers can be searched by name via a SearchView item in the top menu
-	A filter toggle button was added that will only display the YouTubers marked as Favourite
-	Added a feature so a user can now switch the app theme between Night and Day mode as they please
-	YouTuber information is persisted with JSON and also stored in the projects Firebase Firestore Cloud Database

## GitHub workflow

The GitHub workflow used throughout the labs and assignment was:

_Issue - Branch - Commit(s) - Push - Pull Request - Merge - Close Issue - Delete Branch_

## User Interface

**Colour Theme**

The colour theme of this app is simply red, white and black. As YouTube is associated with red, white, and black, these colors were chosen to maintain a familiar YouTube theme.

**App Screens**
