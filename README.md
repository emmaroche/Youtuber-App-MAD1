# Youtuber-App-MAD1

Assignment 1 for Mobile App Development 1

## App Overview

My android mobile app is called the YouTuber App. The YouTuber App offers a way for users to store information about their favourite YouTubers, like their name, channel name, date of birth, an image, and a rating. This app lets a user add, list, update, and delete YouTubers.

## App Functionality

- Add YouTubers with information including their name, channel name, date of birth, image and rating
- List YouTubers
- Edit YouTubers
- Delete YouTubers
- Mark YouTubers as favourite and have a filter result of only the favourited YouTubers in the logcat
- Updated/Improved UI and colour scheme

## Package Structure

The following package structure was followed:

## GitHub workflow

The GitHub workflow used throughout the labs and assignment was:

_Issue - Branch - Commit(s) - Push - Pull Request - Merge - Close Issue - Delete Branch_

## User Interface

**Colour Theme**

The colour theme of this app is simply red, white and black. This was an obvious colour choice as the known colours that represent YouTube are red and white so these colours were chosen to keep a familiar YouTube theme going with this app.

**App Screens**

Add YouTuber Screen (empty)
